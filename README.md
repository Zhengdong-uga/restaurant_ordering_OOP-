# restaurant_ordering_OOP
Goal: Create a business application (of your choice) that showcases mastery of your learned 
programming skills and OOP Design. You will be required to design and implement a system 
that allows a user to run two or more unique scenarios that demonstrate your system’s 
functionalities through the console by choosing options in a menu. These scenarios, along with 
your design plans and decisions will be explained and demonstrated in a final presentation
during the last week of class. More specifics about the system’s requirements can be found 
below

Overview: Develop a business application of Restaurant management system

# Requirements: 
1. Your application should implement at least two end-to-end scenarios that demonstrate 
the functionality of your system.
End-to-end scenarios should be fairy complex, utilizing multiple classes, methods, and 
decision points to accomplish a task. Your two end-to-end scenarios must be distinct.
[Sample end-to-end scenarios can be found in the Resources section on eLC.]
2. Your application should use all four of the collections data types we covered:
• Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, HashSets
Your application should take advantage of these datatypes considering their strengths and 
weaknesses for storing specific datasets. You’ll need to justify your choice for each data 
type in your final presentation. 
Scenario 1: A customer walk 
in our restaurant to order 
foods.
Scenario 2: we now have new 
menu
Array: priceList, foodType(Order class)
HashSet: Menu
ArrayList: newMenu class-add more dishesName
HashMap: Order class-getMenuDatabase 
Fast food production line
Outputs:
Customer’s name
Order number 
Price
Content of order
Inputs: 
Menu
Burgers

At least one of your collections must store a composition (has-A) relationship with one of 
your existing classes. Ex: In our Assignment, we had a Collection of type Employee inside 
the Company class. 
All 4 collections should be utilized in your demonstrated scenarios. Each scenario does not 
need to include all 4 collections – but all 4 must be utilized between the 2 scenarios
3. Your application should follow an OOP design:
• Implement the below principles of object-oriented programming:
o Inheritance (is-A relationships)
o Polymorphism
o Encapsulation
o Composition (has-A relationships)
• Follow an object-oriented programing architecture, using Java facilities to implement 
the above principles. Facilities such as:
o Private attributes, public methods, accessors and mutators.
o Super classes and sub classes
o Method overloading and overriding
o Static data and methods
o Creating and utilizing classes / objects / methods / collections when sensible.
• Your application should take advantage of the OOP principles and use them in a logical 
and rational way to enhance the reusability and configurability of your code while 
decreasing its complexity.
4. Additional Requirements:
• Your two end-to-end scenarios should be designed to utilize all of the features listed 
above.
• Your main method (used to run / demo your program) should not hold the logic for 
your application. This method should exist solely to create instances of your objects and 
call methods when needed. The main method should be very small in comparison to 
your other classes/methods.
• The demonstration of your scenarios in your final presentation should allow a user to 
interact with your system through a printed menu on the console. The decisions made 
by the user should control the program’s flow and update entities based on the user’s 
selections. Sample descriptions of scenarios are provided in the Resources section on 
eLC.
• You need to think about different entities in your business problem and use the best 
OOP architecture to model them. Your last assignment on inheritance models many of 
these items (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, static data members, & some 
of your collection types) but in a much smaller scale. 
• While it is not required – you may choose to “pre-load” your application with data in 
order to showcase your scenarios. The Sample Scenarios Resource on eLC describes 
sample scenarios and what data may need to be pre-loaded to implement them
