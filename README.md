# restaurant_ordering_OOP
Goal: Create a business application (of your choice) that showcases mastery of your learned 
programming skills and OOP Design. You will be required to design and implement a system 
that allows a user to run two or more unique scenarios that demonstrate your system’s 
functionalities through the console by choosing options in a menu. These scenarios, along with 
your design plans and decisions will be explained and demonstrated in a final presentation
during the last week of class. More specifics about the system’s requirements can be found 
below
